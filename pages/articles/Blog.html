                        <h3>Comments on the Video Build A Responsive Website With HTML & CSS Tutorial </h3>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            In the study guide was mostly cover simple stuff, however, it's very educational to see how
                            the professional developer does codding. Usage of hotkeys and a faster way of creating
                            classes and divs amazed me and got a place in my heart forever (Shift + alt + down or .stuff
                            for div). Another big thing that I want to keep from this video is the idea of giving
                            background to the container during the codding process. It's a very simple idea, but it
                            gives you a lot better understanding of where are the things are located and how are they
                            related to each other.</h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            There were few things which seemed super neat like Margin:auto or Display:flex. The flex
                            itself allows you to keep items on the equal distance and easier manipulate them in space.
                            Other useful tools for space manipulation that were introduced in the video were z-index and
                            opacity. Also, I totally forgot that there are 4 numbers in padding and there is no need to
                            make 4 separate lines of code.</h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            There were a couple of times when I took a few big breaks to be able to google stuff from
                            the video. First time it's happened when the blogger introduced box-sizing. I never used it
                            before, but it looks like an amazing tool. The second time it's happened when speaker
                            introduced filter. I was amazed by the idea of adding shade not to the pgn, but to the
                            picture itself. The last big stop was when the developer introduced the concept of @media
                            and @keyframes just because I never really worked with them.</h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            To sum up, I want to say that the video was very useful, and I even subscribed to the
                            channel. It's introduced a lot of concepts which I never heard of and which I'll try to keep
                            for my future developing experience.

                        <h3>3 Common Usability Mistakes In Web Design</h3>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            I read an article about 9 Common Usability Mistakes In Web Design. All of the items on the
                            list are incredibly important for successful web design, however, I decided to concentrate
                            on 3 main ones in my opinion.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Tiny clickable areas are a big issue nowadays. Sometimes it's very hard to press on the
                            specific items or even just to find them. I agree with the first statement of this paragraph
                            which says: "Hyperlinks are designed to be clicked". It sounds obvious, but I saw a lot of
                            websites where this tool wasn't used well enough. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Another big one is "Content that is difficult to scan". I think it's one of the things which
                            makes the difference between good and bad websites. Usually, the user opens a website
                            looking for some specific information and if he wasn't able to find it, there was no point
                            in visiting this page. Having a lot of information with the fancy animation is great, but if
                            we'll take a look at the apple.com website it's obvious that it's not necessary for success
                            at all. I have no doubts, that for a successful website the ability to provide information
                            clearly is necessary. In apple example we don't see as much information, but, honestly, I
                            don't really think that we need more. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            One of my favorite ones from the list is "no way to get in touch". This one is just a
                            must-have not only for successful development but even for successful living. Sometimes it's
                            hard to say that you're doing something incorrectly and the responses from other people
                            might be a very helpful tool to be able to get back on the track. Not all of the comments
                            going to be useful, but some of them may bring a better idea of how to make stuff working
                            together in a better way for the user.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            To sum up, I want to say that it's hard to create a successful design, but we definitely
                            should try to use good practices to be able to avoid making stupid mistakes and not to waste
                            time on something which isn't as good. </h5>

                        <h3>10 Usability Issues To Be Aware Of</h3>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Making a website is a complicated task and to make it simpler, first of all, is very
                            important to learn about useful practices in the programmer's world. The article is big,
                            so in this essay, I'll try to cover the top 10 things which got my attention. To start
                            with, I just want to say that I like the spirit of the whole article itself, it's very
                            motivational and it's lead to the question. If we're not the ones who will try to
                            implement good practices than who?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            The 7+2 principle is a very good practice and it's commonly used not even in IT, but in
                            the presentations. You're trying to put enough information on the slide, so the audience
                            will have an idea about what exactly you're talking about, but it's shouldn't be
                            overwhelming. So if we'll compare the webpages and presentations we'll find out that
                            they have a lot in common. However, the webpages present without speaker and that's one
                            of the biggest differences which makes information flow even more important. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            The 2-second rule is another important one. However, there's not a lot to say about it. No
                            one likes to wait for more than they should. Due to the fact that the competition is high,
                            this can play a decisive role sometimes. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            The 3-click rule isn't as obvious as the previous one, but both of them are related. I never
                            really thought of it, but it's true. Honestly, I feel like nowadays it's more like a 1 or 2
                            click rule. Because when you open a website and you see something unclear, it's easier to
                            open another one, than trying to figure out what is going on this one.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Inverted Pyramid rule is a very commonly used practice because less time you spend trying to
                            figure out what you see is better. Nowadays we have so much more information than we ever
                            had before. That's why it's important to know what exactly you found and is it related to
                            the topic at all. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Satisficing is an interesting thing which from a logical perspective shouldn't really work,
                            however, it does work. Most part of the time when people trying to solve a problem, they
                            don't have high expertise in the subject and may not really enjoy fixing it. So, they're
                            just trying to come up with a fast-sneaky solution which will work. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            One of my favorite ones from the list is "no way to get in touch". This one is just a
                            must-have not only for successful development but even for successful living. Sometimes it's
                            hard to say that you're doing something incorrectly and the responses from other people
                            might be a very helpful tool to be able to get back on the track. Not all of the comments
                            going to be useful, but some of them may bring a better idea of how to make stuff working
                            together in a better way for the user. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Next few I decided to group together because they're related to each other and all of them
                            are based on Gestalt principles of form perception. These principles are the fundamental
                            rules of human psychology in terms of human-computer-interaction-design. The first one is
                            the law of proximity. It's base on the idea that when we see the collection of objects, we
                            tend to think of them as a group. The other important one which usually works together with
                            the previous one is the law of similarity. This law based on the idea that elements will be
                            grouped perceptually if they are similar to each other. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Legibility is a must-have and there is no point to discuss others without thinking of this
                            one. Different techniques are great, but they're not as useful if the text is visually
                            unclear. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            The last, but not least is a design philosophy of user-centered design. The idea is pretty
                            simple, as a developer you need to focus on your users' needs because at the end of the day,
                            they're the ones who you do your work for. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            All those practices are incredibly useful. Sometimes you may want to not use all of them,
                            but it's still highly important to know about them and to be able to recognize and use them
                            as much as it's possible. </h5>

                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                            important to learn about useful practices in the programmer's world. The article covered 5
                            key principles of good website usability.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>The most obvious ones are Availability and Accessibility. Any website is worthless if people
                            are not able to access it. There're a few important factors that may convince the user to
                            reconsider the usage of your websites like server uptime, broken links or bad mobile
                            responsiveness. In the article, the writer provided the amazon.com website as an example of
                            good accessibility because they have versions for different platforms and there is no
                            downtime at all. </h5>

                            The core of usability is clarity because it affects usability dramatically. I think it's one
                            of the things which makes the difference between good and bad websites. Usually, the user
                            opens a website looking for some specific information and if he wasn't able to find it,
                            there was no point in visiting this page. Having a lot of information with the fancy
                            animation is great, but if we'll take a look at the apple.com website it's obvious that it's
                            not necessary for success at all. I have no doubts, that for a successful website the
                            ability to provide information clearly is necessary. In apple example we don't see as much
                            information, but, honestly, I don't really think that we need more. </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Learnability is another important aspect of usability because Web already has been around
                            for a while, so there are some things that are accepted by everyone. As human beings, we
                            like patterns and recognition, which is why we are better at handling familiar situations
                            rather than unfamiliar ones. I think in this situation a better example will be the switch
                            from windows 7 to windows 8. A lot of people were very unhappy because the changes were too
                            massive, so Microsoft came up with 8.1 which was a lot more similar to 7, but home some
                            features from 8.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Credibility is a crucial aspect of any website; I would even say of any business. If people
                            don't trust you, they will never give you money or any other data. Providing good "about us"
                            page is very helpful for establishing the feeling of real company with real people.
                            Providing expertise on topic which is related to the company is another good way to
                            establish trust. </h5>

                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Last but not least, relevancy contributes to good website usability as well. For this
                            aspect, it's necessary to know who your users are and what are their goals. Nowadays it's
                            important to have the user-centered design. The idea is pretty simple, as a developer you
                            need to focus on your users' needs because, at the end of the day, they're the ones who you
                            do your work for.

                        </h5>
                        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            To sum up, I have no doubts that good usability comes slowly with time. It requires a lot of
                            interaction with user to be able to figure out what exactly they want and how to make it
                            better.</h5>
