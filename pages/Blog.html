                                Let's start with the deployment. It's a necessary step for any kind of system. If
                                deployment
                                went incorrectly, in the best-case scenario, the company has a backup system and
                                you'll
                                be
                                able to start all over again. Monolith apps allow you to set your deployment once
                                and
                                then
                                simply adjust it based on ongoing changes. Microservices require much more work
                                because
                                each
                                of the microservices deployed independently. The nice part about it is that if
                                something
                                goes wrong you will only break one piece, which is a lot less problematic to fix
                                than
                                the
                                entire project.</p>

                                Maintenance is another big piece of any project, and from the perspective of
                                maintenance,
                                the biggest feature of microservices architecture is a huge disadvantage because
                                it's a
                                lot
                                harder to track all changes if they're located in multiple different places. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="BlogTextContainer">
                            <p>
                                Obviously, the reliability of the Monolith architecture won't be as good as the
                                reliability
                                of the Microservices architecture. Let's think about the app as a logical tree for a
                                second.
                                In the case of the Monolith, If we're going to implement something on the top of the
                                tree,
                                it's going to affect all of the aspects of it, and if something breaks, it's a lot
                                harder to
                                track it, because even if we're entirely sure where exactly the error has occurred,
                                we
                                may
                                not know what exactly caused the object to break. In the case of the Microservices,
                                we're
                                implementing new features, not at the top of the tree, but to each aspect
                                separately, so
                                if
                                something went wrong, it'll break only this exact entity.
                            </p>

                                From a scalability perspective, the Microservices architecture is a winner again.
                                When
                                we're
                                using the microservices application we're a step ahead from the beginning because
                                the
                                application itself already a collection of loosely coupled services, so it's a lot
                                easier to
                                divide between different workers. In the case of the monolith applications sometimes
                                it's
                                just impossible to add extra workers at all.

                                As we can see Microservices and Monolith architectures are very different from each
                                other
                                and they have a completely different idea behind. In my opinion, it's better to
                                start
                                the
                                application as the Monolith ones and then switch to the Microservices. Microservices
                                architecture brings a lot of cool features that aren't as important at the
                                beginning,
                                but
                                they do sound very juicy later on. It gives advantages such as the ability to: keep
                                changing
                                the product constantly without need of going through the entire project every time,
                                decompose the complex project into a set of manageable services. Also, it
                                significantly
                                improves the scalability and reliability of the project.

                                In the study guide was mostly cover simple stuff, however, it's very educational to
                                see
                                how
                                the professional developer does codding. Usage of hotkeys and a faster way of
                                creating
                                classes and divs amazed me and got a place in my heart forever (Shift + alt + down
                                or
                                .stuff
                                for div). Another big thing that I want to keep from this video is the idea of
                                giving
                                background to the container during the codding process. It's a very simple idea, but
                                it
                                gives you a lot better understanding of where are the things are located and how are
                                they
                                related to each other.</p>

                                There were few things which seemed super neat like Margin:auto or Display:flex. The
                                flex
                                itself allows you to keep items on the equal distance and easier manipulate them in
                                space.
                                Other useful tools for space manipulation that were introduced in the video were
                                z-index
                                and
                                opacity. Also, I totally forgot that there are 4 numbers in padding and there is no
                                need
                                to
                                make 4 separate lines of code.</p>

                                There were a couple of times when I took a few big breaks to be able to google stuff
                                from
                                the video. First time it's happened when the blogger introduced box-sizing. I never
                                used
                                it
                                before, but it looks like an amazing tool. The second time it's happened when
                                speaker
                                introduced filter. I was amazed by the idea of adding shade not to the pgn, but to
                                the
                                picture itself. The last big stop was when the developer introduced the concept of
                                @media
                                and @keyframes just because I never really worked with them.</p>

                                To sum up, I want to say that the video was very useful, and I even subscribed to
                                the
                                channel. It's introduced a lot of concepts which I never heard of and which I'll try
                                to
                                keep
                                for my future developing experience.

                                I read an article about 9 Common Usability Mistakes In Web Design. All of the items
                                on

                                concentrate
                                on 3 main ones in my opinion.

                                Tiny clickable areas are a big issue nowadays. Sometimes it's very hard to press on

                                specific items or even just to find them. I agree with the first statement of this

                                which says: "Hyperlinks are designed to be clicked". It sounds obvious, but I saw a
                                lot
                                of
                                websites where this tool wasn't used well enough.</p>

                                Another big one is "Content that is difficult to scan". I think it's one of the
                                things
                                which
                                makes the difference between good and bad websites. Usually, the user opens a
                                website
                                looking for some specific information and if he wasn't able to find it, there was no
                                point
                                in visiting this page. Having a lot of information with the fancy animation is
                                great,
                                but if
                                we'll take a look at the apple.com website it's obvious that it's not necessary for
                                success
                                at all. I have no doubts, that for a successful website the ability to provide
                                information
                                clearly is necessary. In apple example we don't see as much information, but,
                                honestly,
                                I
                                don't really think that we need more. </p>

                                it's
                                hard to say that you're doing something incorrectly and the responses from other
                                people
                                might be a very helpful tool to be able to get back on the track. Not all of the

                                going to be useful, but some of them may bring a better idea of how to make stuff

                                To sum up, I want to say that it's hard to create a successful design, but we
                                definitely
                                should try to use good practices to be able to avoid making stupid mistakes and not
                                to
                                waste

                                Making a website is a complicated task and to make it simpler, first of all, is very
                                important to learn about useful practices in the programmer's world. The article is
                                big,
                                so in this essay, I'll try to cover the top 10 things which got my attention. To
                                start
                                with, I just want to say that I like the spirit of the whole article itself, it's
                                very
                                motivational and it's lead to the question. If we're not the ones who will try to
                                implement good practices than who?

                                The 7+2 principle is a very good practice and it's commonly used not even in IT, but
                                in
                                the presentations. You're trying to put enough information on the slide, so the
                                audience
                                will have an idea about what exactly you're talking about, but it's shouldn't be
                                overwhelming. So if we'll compare the webpages and presentations we'll find out that
                                they have a lot in common. However, the webpages present without speaker and that's
                                one
                                of the biggest differences which makes information flow even more important. </p>

                                The 2-second rule is another important one. However, there's not a lot to say about
                                it.
                                No
                                one likes to wait for more than they should. Due to the fact that the competition is
                                high,
                                this can play a decisive role sometimes. </p>

                                The 3-click rule isn't as obvious as the previous one, but both of them are related.
                                I
                                never
                                really thought of it, but it's true. Honestly, I feel like nowadays it's more like a
                                1
                                or 2
                                click rule. Because when you open a website and you see something unclear, it's
                                easier
                                to
                                open another one, than trying to figure out what is going on this one.

                                Inverted Pyramid rule is a very commonly used practice because less time you spend
                                trying to
                                figure out what you see is better. Nowadays we have so much more information than we
                                ever
                                had before. That's why it's important to know what exactly you found and is it
                                related
                                to
                                the topic at all. </p>

                                Satisficing is an interesting thing which from a logical perspective shouldn't
                                really
                                work,
                                however, it does work. Most part of the time when people trying to solve a problem,
                                they
                                don't have high expertise in the subject and may not really enjoy fixing it. So,
                                they're
                                just trying to come up with a fast-sneaky solution which will work. </p>

                                Next few I decided to group together because they're related to each other and all
                                of
                                them
                                are based on Gestalt principles of form perception. These principles are the
                                fundamental
                                rules of human psychology in terms of human-computer-interaction-design. The first
                                one
                                is
                                the law of proximity. It's base on the idea that when we see the collection of
                                objects,
                                we
                                tend to think of them as a group. The other important one which usually works
                                together
                                with
                                the previous one is the law of similarity. This law based on the idea that elements
                                will
                                be
                                grouped perceptually if they are similar to each other. </p>

                                Legibility is a must-have and there is no point to discuss others without thinking
                                of
                                this
                                one. Different techniques are great, but they're not as useful if the text is
                                visually

                                The last, but not least is a design philosophy of user-centered design. The idea is
                                pretty
                                simple, as a developer you need to focus on your users' needs because at the end of
                                the
                                day,

                                All those practices are incredibly useful. Sometimes you may want to not use all of
                                them,
                                but it's still highly important to know about them and to be able to recognize and

                                    reconsider the usage of your websites like server uptime, broken links or bad
                                    mobile
                                    responsiveness. In the article, the writer provided the amazon.com website as an
                                    example of
                                    good accessibility because they have versions for different platforms and there
                                    is no
                                    downtime at all. </p>

                                    The core of usability is clarity because it affects usability dramatically. I
                                    think it's one
                                    of the things which makes the difference between good and bad websites. Usually,
                                    the user
                                    opens a website looking for some specific information and if he wasn't able to
                                    find it,
                                    there was no point in visiting this page. Having a lot of information with the
                                    fancy
                                    animation is great, but if we'll take a look at the apple.com website it's
                                    obvious that it's
                                    not necessary for success at all. I have no doubts, that for a successful
                                    website the
                                    ability to provide information clearly is necessary. In apple example we don't
                                    see as much
                                    information, but, honestly, I don't really think that we need more. </p>

                                    Learnability is another important aspect of usability because Web already has
                                    been around
                                    for a while, so there are some things that are accepted by everyone. As human
                                    beings, we
                                    like patterns and recognition, which is why we are better at handling familiar
                                    situations
                                    rather than unfamiliar ones. I think in this situation a better example will be
                                    the switch
                                    from windows 7 to windows 8. A lot of people were very unhappy because the
                                    changes were too
                                    massive, so Microsoft came up with 8.1 which was a lot more similar to 7, but
                                    home some
                                    features from 8.

                                    Credibility is a crucial aspect of any website; I would even say of any
                                    business. If people
                                    don't trust you, they will never give you money or any other data. Providing
                                    good "about us"
                                    page is very helpful for establishing the feeling of real company with real
                                    people.
                                    Providing expertise on topic which is related to the company is another good way
                                    to
                                    establish trust. </p>

                                    Last but not least, relevancy contributes to good website usability as well. For
                                    this
                                    aspect, it's necessary to know who your users are and what are their goals.
                                    Nowadays it's
                                    important to have the user-centered design. The idea is pretty simple, as a
                                    developer you
                                    need to focus on your users' needs because, at the end of the day, they're the
                                    ones who you
                                    do your work for.

                                    To sum up, I have no doubts that good usability comes slowly with time. It
                                    requires a lot of
                                    interaction with user to be able to figure out what exactly they want and how to
                                    make it
                                    better. </p>
