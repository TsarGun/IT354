                            <p>
                                The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                                Boolean,Null,Undefined,Number,String,Symbol and Object. An object is a collection of
                                properties.These properties are stored in key/value pairs. Properties can reference any
                                type of data, including objects and/or primitive values.
                                First six data types are the primitives. The first one is a Undefined type.
                                A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.
                                The second one is a Null type.
                                The Null type has exactly one value: null.
                                The third one is a Boolean type.
                                Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.
                                The fourth one is a String type.
                                JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of
                                16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the
                                String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a
                                String is the number of elements in it.
                                Unlike some programming languages (such as C), JavaScript strings are immutable. This
                                means
                                that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.
                                However, it is still possible to create another string based on an operation on the
                                original
                                string.
                                The fith one is a Symbol type.
                                Symbols are new to JavaScript in ECMAScript 2015. A Symbol is a unique and immutable
                                primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property. In some
                                programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms".
                                The sixth one is a Number type.
                                The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value (numbers
                                between
                                -(9.0071993e+15 − 1) and 9.0071993e+15 − 1). In addition to being able to represent
                                floating-point numbers, the number type has three Unique values: +Infinity, -Infinity,
                                and
                                NaN ("Not a Number"). To check for the largest available value or smallest available
                                value
                                within ±Infinity, you can use the constants Number.MAX_VALUE or Number.MIN_VALUE. </p>

                                <p>Basically, when Javascript compiles all of your code, all variable declarations using
                                    var are
                                    hoisted/lifted to the top of their functional/local scope (if declared inside a
                                    function) or
                                    to the top of their global scope (if declared outside of a function) regardless of
                                    where the
                                    actual declaration has been made. This is what we mean by “hoisting”.
                                    Functions declarations are also hoisted, but these go to the very top, so will sit
                                    above all
                                    of the variable declarations.As we mentioned earlier, variables get moved to the top
                                    of
                                    their scope when your Javascript compiles at runtime (which — if we exclude the use
                                    of
                                    NodeJS — at a very basic level simply means as your webpage is loading). However, a
                                    key
                                    thing to note is that the only thing that gets moved to the top is the variable
                                    declarations
                                    , not the actual value given to the variable.ust to clarify what we mean, if we had
                                    a chunk
                                    of code and let’s say that on Line 10, we had var myName = 'Sunil', when the
                                    Javascript gets
                                    compiled, var myName would get moved to the top of its scope, whilst myName =
                                    'Sunil' would
                                    stay on Line 10 (or possibly now Line 11 if var myName were hoisted up onto Line 1).
